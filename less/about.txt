> `lessphp` is a compiler for Less written in PHP.

**lessphp** is a compiler that generates CSS from a superset language which
adds a collection of convenient features often seen in other languages. All CSS
is compatible with Less, so you can start using new features with your existing CSS.

It is designed to be compatible with [less.js](http://lesscss.org), and suitable
as a drop in replacement for PHP projects.
